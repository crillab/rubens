/**
 * A class used to retrieve all the available {@link CheckerFactory} instances.
 * It implements the Singleton design pattern; call {@link CheckerFactoryReflector#getInstance()} to get its (only) instance.
 * 
 * It ignores the factories marked as disabled and allows to get a new instance of one given its name.
 * Each factory may be disabled or named by a unique string.
 * See {@link ReflectorParam} annotation for more information about disabling and naming factories.
 * 
 * As this class uses the reflection mechanism, {@link CheckerFactory} implementors must be correctly exported in order to be visible.
